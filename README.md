Hello! This is a homework project for an R class at CSU. The instructions were
to download a data set on homicides in the US. I chose to work on one city, 
Washington, DC. We had to create an sf object using tigris data to show the 
underlying sub-city geometry. I chose to use state legislative districts.
I then pared down the data to the top three races as well as the disposition 
for unsolved and solved cases. I then created the plot with points as the top 
three races and facet wrapped by disposition, and messed around with the themes.

Enjoy!
